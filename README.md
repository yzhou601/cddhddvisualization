# cddhddvisualization




## Introduction
* This script is used to plot cooling degree days and heating degree days calculated from .epw file
* To sort the data by climate zones, the .stat files are also required. (There's cdd and hdd information in stat files as well, the data sources might be different for different locations)
* The base temperature is 65F (18.3333C)
* The calculation method is from :http://www.vesma.com/ddd/ddcalcs.htm, which is more accurate than the simple approximation methods according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_degree_day)
* This script can only work for the .epw weather files that are able to be read by pyepw package
* The spread sheets generated by running the first part of code include all the cdd and hdd results calculated for US locations and are sorted by climate zones. If the first part is needed, notice: to generate the weather information for climates all over US (including some extreme climates), some source code of pyepw package is changed to broaden some ranges that could be read by pyepw
* Dash library is used for plotting the data
